  Hacktoberfest example

  Suppose we have some code issues to be solved by people out there on the internet.
  Here is an example: an unfinished function f()

*/
#include <iostream>

void f() {
  // TODO: implement this, it should print hello!
  std::cout << "hello!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  f();  

}
